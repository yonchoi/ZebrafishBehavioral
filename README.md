# ZebrafishBehavioral

This repository uses sequence based model (GPT) to model temporal behavioral features of zebrafish in order to associate fish behavior pattern to diseased state of the fish and potentially identify motifs. Features such as (distance moved, speed, angle) were calculated from time series of x,y coordinates, before fed into the model.

 The main model is a form of GPT from hugging-face.

# Installation
