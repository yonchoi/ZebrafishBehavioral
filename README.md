# ZebrafishBehavioral

This repository tests variety of sequence based model ranging from LSTM to GPT for modeling temporal behavioral features of zebrafish in order to associate fish behavior pattern to diseased state of the fish and potentially identify motifs. Features such as (distance moved, speed, angle) were calculated from time series of x,y coordinates, before fed into the model.
